 Developed a kernel module that can be used to play a Blackjack game.
This game contains a standard deck with 52 cards. Each card has a suit and value. For example, 7 of clubs, Ace of spades, queen of hearts. In Blackjack, the dealer will deal two cards to each player. Each player will then have an option of taking more cards and attempt to get as close to 21 without going over.
An Ace will have a value of 11 unless that would give a player or the dealer a score more than 21; in which case, it has a value of 1. Face cards are worth 10 and number cards are worth the number printed on the card.
